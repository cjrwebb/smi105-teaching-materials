## Learning outcomes

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[What will I learn?]

By the end of this week you will know:

* How to take the publication medium your data visualisation will feature in into account when exporting and deciding on size, orientation, and so on

* How to apply different technical terms from print &amp; design to describe differences in quality, orientation, size (e.g. aspect ratio), and method of reproduction (rasterised versus vectorised)

* How to make your data visualisation look good no matter where it's published!

Again, the background changes to make it seamless and in the phone and presentation slide versions I have **removed the place names**, because that information could be hidden and only shown on tap/hover/click. I also cut off Scotland and Northern Ireland to maximise the size and give the text the best chance of being readable.

# Publishing a data visualisation: Print

.pull-left[

### How do we optimise the publication of data visualisation in print?

Things we want to consider:

* Layout, aspect ratio and orientation
* In-line versus stand-alone (splitting up the page)
* Resolution (dpi)
* Colour (or lack thereof!)
* File types (raster or vector images)

All of these sound obvious, but on a big project it can be easy for them to go wrong! **You can have beautiful design, but if it doesn't suit the publication medium, it will look bad!**

If colour is allowed:

* High contrast works better (at least 20% difference between colours)
* Avoid white on black for text
* Avoid text font sizes smaller than size 6 
* Avoid transparency, use low saturation shades that blend into the background instead
* **Consider the base colour of the paper it's being printed on** â if it's brilliant white, use a more grey font colour (to avoid the contrast being too high). If it's off-white (e.g. newspaper), use black.

Things we want to consider:

* Layout, aspect ratio and orientation
* In-line versus stand-alone (splitting up the page)
* Resolution (dpi)
* Colour (or lack thereof!)
* **File types (raster or vector images)**
  * Files come in many types: .png, .jpeg/.jpg, .tif/.tiff, .svg, .eps. Some file types are *rasterised* (drawn with pixels/dots), while others are *vectorised* (drawn with maths). Raster files work better when there is a lot of unique elements and colours, vector files work better when there are fewer elements and colours. 

]

.pull-right[

* **.TIFF** files are still popular with print media today because they are lossless (there is no compression to make the file size smaller â remember, we don't need to worry about file size because paper doesn't need to load!) and support more colours (other file formats were designed to be used with the limitations of screens).

Saving as .tiff: `ggsave("ex_plot1.tiff"), width = 4, height = 4)`

* **.EPS** files are the vectorised file of choice for print media. They store instructions on how to reproduce the shapes on your plot by drawing them, which means the data visualisation can be reproduced with no loss in quality at any size (because the shape is not broken down into pixels).

Saving as .eps: `ggsave("ex_plot1.eps"), width = 4, height = 4)`

**However, only professionals may have the software required to view these formats. More common formats that everyone can view (e.g. on phones) might be .png or .jpeg**

Web images tend to have a fixed value of **72ppi** (pixels per inch) â much lower than the 600dpi of print media.

Rather, increased quality tends to be linked to **increased resolution** of images, for example:

* 1280 pixels (width) x 720 pixels (height), a.k.a. 720p
* 1920 x 1080 a.k.a. 1080p
* 3840 Ã 2160 a.k.a. 4k Ultra HD

**More pixels doesn't always mean better**, the best number of pixels is the *minimum number required to provide a clear, crisp graphic*. Too many pixels means the graphic will take longer to load, which is problematic because:

* The probability of someone giving up on the image loading increases by 32% between 1 second and 3 seconds. 
* Your graphic will take longer to load with excess resolution/file size in countries with poorer internet access
* You are trading a clear image for a *bad user experience*.

Things we want to consider:

### How do we optimise the publication of data visualisation online?

* Device (laptop/desktop, mobile, tablet)
* Common aspect ratios and formats
* In-line versus standalone versus dashboard
* Interactive or static
* **File types (raster or vector images)**

]

.pull-right[

**.PNG** files are the most common rasterised file format for web graphics (and for a lot of print). They support transparency and usually do not lose as much quality when compressed (file size is reduced to save space).

`ggsave("ex_plot1.png")`

**.JPG/JPEG** files are also a common rasterised file format, but is now less common than png files. 

`ggsave("ex_plot1.jpg")`

**.SVG** files are the most common vector file format found online, commonly used for text logos and infographics. Like other vectore file formats, SVG files do not support transparency.

`ggsave("ex_plot1.svg")`

## Summary

* While the idea of taking your data visualisation from R and into publication after applying good graphic design principles may seem straightforward, there are a lot of considerations to make to ensure your data visualisation works *within* a publication.

* There are some common formats and standards that you can follow in order to identify how to size, set the quality, and include interaction or other features within your data visualisation.

* Key questions to ask yourself:
  * Print? Digital? Both?
  * Is there a one-size fits all for your audiences, or do you need some different versions?
  * How can you balance visual quality and user experience (speed of loading)?
  * Should your visualisation be viewed in-line with text, or is it standalone?

## Workshop this week

Letâs start drawing **maps**. Weâre going to work with some existing data that includes spatial information to draw different kinds of maps, and consider the information that needs to be included when we draw maps.

## Tasks to look at in advance of Week 8

#### Core tasks:

**Before lecture**: Find a map in the news that is being used to present some data. Then, share on Blackboard: (i) the map you find, (ii) where it was published (if thatâs not obvious) and (iii) one observation about how well, or not, you think it is integrated into the place where it has been published (one sentence will do).

**Before lecture**: Read [When maps shouldnât be maps](http://www.ericson.net/content/2011/10/when-maps-shouldnt-be-maps/) http://www.ericson.net/content/2011/10/when-maps-shouldnt-be-maps/

**Before workshop**: Work through the task at the end of the workshop handout

**Supplementary tasks**:

* Before workshop: Read chapter 7/Draw maps of the Healy book
