## Learning outcomes

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[What will I learn?]

By the end of this week you will:

* Lecture: How to 'read' a data visualisation, how to identify key structural and aesthetic parameters in their construction, and how they can be manipulated.

* Lecture: What social and societal factors influence engagement.

* Workshop: How to create bar charts to visualise data

&lt;br&gt;

### The Anatomy of a Chart

* **The Title**
  * Is there a title?
  * Does the title give you information about what to expect from the chart?
  * Does the chart show or support what the title states?

&lt;br&gt;

### The Anatomy of a Chart

* The Title
* **The Key/Legend**
  * Is there a key?
  * What does it tell you about the different colours &amp; shapes in the chart?
  * Does it help you understand how to read it?
  * The key is not always a separate element, sometimes it can be embedded in the title (e.g. certain colours highlighted)

.pull-right-small[

&lt;br&gt;

### The Anatomy of a Chart

* The Title
* The Key/Legend
* **The Axes &amp; Scales**
  * What are the scales? (positions on X &amp; Y axis, size of points, shade of colour)
  * Do the scales start at 0? If not, why not?
  * What is the range of values?
  * Which values are good or bad, high or low?
  * Have the scales been transformed in any way or are they linear? (linear means that, for example, an increase of 5 covers the same distance anywhere on the axis)

### The Anatomy of a Chart

* The Title
* The Key/Legend
* The Axes &amp; Scales
* **The Data**
  * What are the biggest categories? Do they represent proportions, relative differences, or frequencies? (Bar Charts/Histograms/Area Charts)
  * What is the relationship between two variables? (e.g. Scatterplots, Heatmaps, Stacked/Grouped Bar Charts)
  * What is the relationship over time (when one axis is time, line charts)? Is upward movement good or bad? Do lines interact? Are there seasonal trends? 
  * How much *variation* is there, and is variation shown at all?

### The Anatomy of a Chart

* The Title

* **The Source of the Data**
  * Is there a source provided?
  * Can the source of the data be trusted/verified?
  * If there is no source, can we be sure the data is accurate and truthful? How easy would it be to verify?
  * Has the author been willing to put their name on the visualisation? If not, why not?

# The rest of this week:

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

**This week's workshop**:

Let’s extend bar charts. Last week we drew our first bar chart, but we can do better. What if we want to make the categories easier to interpret? What if we want to put the categories in descending order? What if we want to have bar charts that have the average of different categories, rather than just the number of categories that there are?

**Before week 3**:

**Core tasks**:

* **Before lecture**: Give yourself two minutes. See how many different ways you can visualise this dataset: 75, 37 (yes, it is a dataset that only has two numbers in it). Use pen and paper to sketch all the different ways you can think of to visually compare these two numbers. Share (on the Blackboard Discussion thread) the total number of ways you find.

* **Before lecture**: Read the first half of the second chapter, pages 17-42, A Narrative Approach to Data Storytelling, in Feigenbaum, A. and Alamalhodaei, A. (2020) The Data Storytelling Workbook, Routledge

* **Before workshop**: Work through the task at the end of the workshop handout from week 2
