## Learning outcomes

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[What will I learn?]

By the end of this week you will:

* Lecture: How the module will operate, where to find more information, how to navigate the module resources, and what we will be doing each week.

* Lecture: What is data visualisation, why do we do it, why does it matter, and how will we approach it?

* Workshop: First steps in `ggplot2` and `R`: how do we create visualisations of data in `R`

#### Part I

# Overview of the module: How will it work?


---

class: middle

# By the end of this module, you should know about:

.pull-left[

<br>

* The **theory** of data visualisation
* The **practice** of data visualisation
* How to be **critical** about both the theory and practice of data visualisation

To do that, you will be learning how to *create* data visualisations using `R`, how to *design* data visualisations using best practice, and how to be *critical* of the data visualisations you make and see.

We don't assume you know anything about data visualisation, coding, or information design before starting this class!

# Logistics

* **Two** teaching sessions per week: 1 hour lecture & 1.5 hour practical workshop

--

* **Lectures** will mostly focus on theory and critical awareness
    * 4pm - 4:50pm Sheffield University Management School, MS Lowe Memorial LT03 (Uphill from the Wave) (Tuesdays, Week 1-5, 7-11)

--

* **Workshops** will focus on the practice of creating data visualisations
    * 09:00-10:30/10:30-12:00/12:00-13:30 in The Wave, Computer Room 2A (Thursdays Week 1-5, 7-11), check your timetable for group allocation.

--

* Slides and worksheets will be posted on Blackboard, usually worksheets will be posted after the workshops.

* Lectures will be recorded either via Encore Lecture Capture or Blackboard Collaborate. **We do our best to ensure all lectures are recorded, but cannot guarantee this.**

# Lecture recordings and uploaded worksheets are <u>not</u> a replacement for attending lectures and worksheets.

# If attendance at lectures and workshops becomes very poor, we will stop providing lecture recordings.

# Weekly Tasks

* For most weeks there are **core** and **supplementary** tasks. 

  * **You are required to complete core weekly tasks**. These are *formative* (ungraded) assessments; you will receive group feedback in the weekly workshops to help you improve and prepare for your *summative* (graded) assessments.
  
  * A full breakdown of all weekly tasks and topics is available [in the module handbook/resource list](https://calumwebb.co.uk/teaching/smi105-content/reading-list/).
  
  * You are not required to complete the supplementary tasks, but you will probably do better in your assessment if you do.

class: middle, inverse

## This is a 10-credit module and therefore it is expected it will require 100 study hours per student. Formal teaching hours for this module will take 25 hours (lectures and workshops). Therefore, as a rough guide, this means you should expect to devote around 5 hours of study time per week to this module during a 15-week semester.

class: middle

# Assessment

.pull-left[

There are two assessments:

* **Assessment 1**: due in November, is worth **30% of final grade**. You will be provided with some real contemporary social science data and asked to produce several different graphs and reflect on what they tell us about the topic.


* **Assessment 2**: due in January, is worth **70% of final grade**. You will be asked to critique and reflect on a published article that contains a data visualisation, and consider how it might be improved. Then, you will need to improve it using the same or related data, explaining the decisions you took.

# Getting help with your studies

.pull-left[

* **Consultation and Feedback hours**

I run two Consultation and Feedback hours per week, you can ask me questions about SMI105.

If you want to book an appointment with me, please use the calendar [here](https://calendar.app.google/3N7v2r6zPYFo4SL7A) or on Blackboard.

* **Piazza Discussion Board**

If you have any questions about the module or any tasks, including errors with `R` code, you can post for help on [the Piazza Discussion Board](https://piazza.com/shef.ac.uk/fall2024/smi105). This is accessible through Blackboard. Also, try to help other students with their questions — it will help you learn!

# Data Visualisation 4

**.tuos_blue[What is the main purpose?]**

* To communicate information

* To tell a story

* To use our visual sense to understand data, detect patterns, etc., rather than language and logical processing

* To look cool! Data visualisation can be art. E.g. see Generative Data Visualisation Art by [Thomas Lin Pedersen](https://thomaslinpedersen.art/work/) and [Danielle Navarro](https://art.djnavarro.net/gallery/)

# Summary: So, what is data visualisation?

* Data visualisation is an **object** — a chart, a graph, a map — that follows a set of rules and principles, where parameters are defined by data

--

* Data visualisation is also a **process** — an act of transformation and reproduction of best practice in order to tell a story or to make sense of the world visually

--

* Data visualisation is also a **social phenomenon** — it is related to power, can reinforce or challenges societal norms or assumptions, and shapes how people engage with information

# The rest of this week:

.pull-left[

<br><br>

**This week's workshop**:

* Computer Room 2a, SMI, The Wave
* You can take and use your own laptop if you like
* 09:00-10:30, 10:30-12:00, or 12:00-13:30

**Do you know when and where you are going?**

If not clear from your timetable which group you're in, email [smi@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:smi@sheffield.ac.uk) 

**You will not be permitted to move group without a very good reason.**

**Before week 2**:

**Core tasks**:
* Before lecture: Read this module handbook in full
* Before workshop: If you’ve got a personal machine, get R and RStudio installed on it (instructions on how to do this will be in the Week 2 learning resources folder)
* Having done so, work through the workshop handout once again to check it works on your machine (if it doesn’t, don’t worry, we’ll go through and troubleshoot it together)

**Supplementary tasks:**

* Before lecture: Read Top 5 things to look for in a visualisation on the Seeing Data website: https://seeingdata.org/developing-visualisation-literacy/top-5-things-to-look-for-in-a-visualisation/
