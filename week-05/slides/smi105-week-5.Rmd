## Tufte's (1983/2001) Graphical Excellence & Elegance

Edward Tufte's revolutionised the way that data visualisation was done by introducing principles of excellence and elegance:

> "Graphical excellence consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision and efficiency." (p.51)

> "Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space." (p.51)

For Tufte (at least in 1983/2001), we should aim to 'maximise the ink to information ratio' and avoid introducing extraneous stylistic elements that, at best, do nothing and, at worst, might influence perception of the data — communicate the most information in the least amount of ink. What does this mean?

# The life and death(?) of chartjunk

## Chartjunk & misrepresentation

Edward Tufte particularly took issue with what he called **"chartjunk"**; the "interior decoration of graphics [that] does not tell the viewer anything new". In addition, he raised the issues of **misrepresentation and integrity** that often accompanied misuse of area/scale

* **Integrity and misrepresentation of scale**: misrepresenting differences between things: a square with twice the area of one that measures 10cm x 10cm would measure ~14cm x 14cm, not 20cm x 20cm

* .grey[Unintentional optical art: eye-straining effects that had "no place in data graphical design" (or arguably, any form of graphical design)]

* .grey[Extraneous gridlines: gridlines that only exist as a relic from drawing visualisations by hand that distract the viewer.]

* .grey[The graphical duck: unneccesary additions to the visualisation (e.g. colour) where it does not add any information, and is done just because "it can be done".]

## The influence of, and a critique of, Tufte's approach

Note how, in the workshops, many of the defaults that are used by ggplot (and other packages) tend to use the same kind of best practice that Tufte recommended: **no more thick gridlines, no more unnecessary crosshatching, and you have to try quite hard to misrepresent your data**.

However, of we remove everything that isn't strictly necessary, where does that leave **design, art, and the influence it can have on engagement and communication for different audiences**? What does "default ink" look like in a digital world? What if elegant isn't your aesthetic?

> "Embellishments can at times, when properly chosen and designed, represent information redundantly in useful ways, and even when they aren't information in and of themselves, can meaningfully support the display of information."
